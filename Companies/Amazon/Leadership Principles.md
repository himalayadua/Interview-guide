## Customer Obsession
key points:
- start with the customer and work backwards
- example:
    - said that Jeff Bezos brings an empty chair into board meetings, 
    - reserved for the customer, to remind the room who they should be thinking of above all else
- spend some time thinking about your experiences with customers, both good and bad
- What strategies have you used to attract customers, and then to make sure they remain satisfied? 
- When did you fail to satisfy a customer's needs, and how did you correct the situation?

> "Tell me about an occasion when you used customer input to enhance or innovate your organization."

> Tell me about a time when you strongly disagreed with your manager or peer on something you considered very important to the business.

> To try to meet the high expectations of our customers, we sometimes promise more than we can deliver. Tell me about a time when you overcommitted yourself or your company.

## Ownership
key points:
- 

> Describe a time when you took on work outside of your comfort area.

> Describe a situation where you made an important business decision without consulting your manager.

## Invent and Simplify
key points:
- be externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere.
- Part of this means being brave 
- changing the way things are traditionally done can often be misunderstood 
- Think of times in your professional past 
    - where you disrupted the status quo
- When did you find a way of simplifying a process, or made one more efficient and quicker? 
- Can you give an example of an idea you had that didn't work out, and what you managed to learn from it regardless?

> Tell me about a time when you didn't meet customer's needs.

> Give me an example of a complex problem you solved with a simple solution.

## Good Judgement
key points:
- have strong judgment and good instincts
- seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs
- you are expected to have excellent decision making abilities
- `Amazon sees disagreement as valuable`
- find examples of times 
    - in which you chose a good way forward from a number of conflicting options.
- Was there a time where you adopted a successful idea despite it not being in line with the one you had? 

> "Give me an example of a time when a member of your team pushed you to consider a problem in a fresh light. What was the outcome?"

> Tell me about a time when you did not effectively manage your projects and something did not get completed on time.

> Tell me about a time you wouldn't compromise on achieving a great outcome when others felt something was good enough.

## Learn (Be Curious)
key points:
- always seek to improve yourself
- What worked yesterday may not work for long
- strong emphasis on everyone being open to learning new things
- `Amazon values individuals who are open and eager to learn`
- Show your interviewer 
    - your curiosity and passion for learning 
    - by talking about things you have recently started learning
    - professionally but also in your personal life
- Think of times when you discovered something new and shared it with your team
    - introducing a new way of doing things

> Give me an example of a mission or goal you didn't think was achievable. 

> Give me an example of something that you've worked on to improve your overall work effectiveness.

## Hire and Develop the Best
key points:
- they don't hire who do not add value to the company
- emphasize the value you bring to the table
- you must always be ready to share your expertise and mentor fellow employees
- Give an example of an employee who you helped grow professionally. 
- If you don't have managerial experience
    - you can talk about how your supported members of your team and helped them develop.

> Tell me about a time when you received negative feedback.

> Describe a time when you improved morale and productivity on your team.

## Insist on the Highest Standards
key points:
- have relentlessly high standards 
- many people may think these standards are unreasonably high
- Showcase your high standards by talking 
    - about the emphasis you put on detail in your work
    - how you ensure that your end product is always top-notch
- Give your interviewer examples of when you raised the bar to meet your customer's requirements
- how your customer obsession helped you meet those goals

> When did your high standards help push the organizations performance forward?

> Tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult customer or user.

> Tell me about a time when you used external trends to improve your own company's products or services.

## Think Big
key points:
- 

> Give an example of a creative idea you had that proved really difficult to implement.

> Tell me about a time when you encouraged a team member or organization to take a big risk.

## Act Rapidly (Bias for Action)
key points:
- 

> Give me an example of a calculated risk that you have taken where speed was critical.

> Tell me about a time where you were the first one to take action on something.

## Frugality (Use Your Resources Wisely)
key points:
- 

> Tell me about a time you pushed back on a deadline.

> Give me an example of how you have helped save costs or eliminate waste within your role or organization.

## Earn Trust
key points:
- 

> Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a colleague or manager.

> Describe a time when you needed to influence a peer who had a differing opinion about a shared goal.

## Dive Deep
key points:
- 

> Tell me about a time when you had to communicate a change in direction that you anticipated people would have concerns with.

> Tell me about a time where you were thrown into a project where you had no experience in.

## Have a Backbone; Disagree and Commit
key points:
- 

> Often, we must make decisions as a group. Give me an example of a time you committed to a group decision even though you disagreed.

> Tell me about a time where you disagreed with a coworker or PM or manager because you believed the decision they wanted to make was wrong for the customer.

## Deliver Results
key points:
- 

> Could you tell me about a time where you were working on a project where you were working with another person.    
>> Over time, that person lessened their involvement in the project and you had to take on more responsibility.

> Tell me about a strategic decision you had to make without clear data or benchmarks.
