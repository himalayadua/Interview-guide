## Customer Obsession
key points:
- start with the customer and work backwards
- example:
    - said that Jeff Bezos brings an empty chair into board meetings, 
    - reserved for the customer, to remind the room who they should be thinking of above all else
- spend some time thinking about your experiences with customers, both good and bad
- What strategies have you used to attract customers, and then to make sure they remain satisfied? 
- When did you fail to satisfy a customer's needs, and how did you correct the situation?
