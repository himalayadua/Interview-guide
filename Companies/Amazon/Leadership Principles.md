## Customer Obsession
key points:
- start with the customer and work backwards
- example:
    - said that Jeff Bezos brings an empty chair into board meetings, 
    - reserved for the customer, to remind the room who they should be thinking of above all else
- spend some time thinking about your experiences with customers, both good and bad
- What strategies have you used to attract customers, and then to make sure they remain satisfied? 
- When did you fail to satisfy a customer's needs, and how did you correct the situation?

> "Tell me about an occasion when you used customer input to enhance or innovate your organization."

> Tell me about a time when you strongly disagreed with your manager or peer on something you considered very important to the business.

> To try to meet the high expectations of our customers, we sometimes promise more than we can deliver. Tell me about a time when you overcommitted yourself or your company.

## Invent and Simplify
key points:
- be externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere.
- Part of this means being brave 
- changing the way things are traditionally done can often be misunderstood 
- Think of times in your professional past 
    - where you disrupted the status quo
- When did you find a way of simplifying a process, or made one more efficient and quicker? 
- Can you give an example of an idea you had that didn't work out, and what you managed to learn from it regardless?

> Tell me about a time when you didn't meet customer's needs.

> Give me an example of a complex problem you solved with a simple solution.

## Good Judgement
key points:
- have strong judgment and good instincts
- seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs
- you are expected to have excellent decision making abilities
- `Amazon sees disagreement as valuable`
- find examples of times 
    - in which you chose a good way forward from a number of conflicting options.
- Was there a time where you adopted a successful idea despite it not being in line with the one you had? 

> "Give me an example of a time when a member of your team pushed you to consider a problem in a fresh light. What was the outcome?"
